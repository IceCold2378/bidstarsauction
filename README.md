# bidstarsauction
"BidStars" is an online auction web site aimed at taking the auction to the finger tips of aspiring bidders there by opening up the doors of the "OPEN Auction House” to a wider range of categories and not just the same old “Art Lovers” and “Antique Collectors” as the only categories. 
**MOTIVATION**
The existing system requires the auctioneer and the bidder/purchaser to physically meet. This process ends up being costly and at the same time, it is time consuming for both the auctioneer and bidder.
Another problem of the old system is to track each bidding process and to make it culminate in financial settlement. So the system has to keep records of both buyers and sellers until the end of settlement.  
**Results of the Project**
•   We have developed a working online auction site which allows users to register and login into our bidding database free of cost ,followed by the options to bid on particular items listed in the auctions portal.
•  The bidding portal allows various bidders to bid on the item until the max price of the item has reached or the item’s time has expired. The products are shown in categories thereby helping the users to search for items he/she wants to bid
•  A contact us form is also available in case the user find any discrepancies regarding our site and its working. This will be resolved via mail.
•  We have also built and admin access to our bidding portal to manage the various items that are up for auction and to ensure that no issues occur in the site.
